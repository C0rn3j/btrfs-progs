Custom ioctls
=============

Anything that's not doing the other features and stands on it's own

- reverse lookup, from file offset to inode

- resolve inode number -> name

- file offset -> all inodes that share it

- tree search, all the metadata at your hand (if you know what to do with them)

- informative (device, fs, space)

- query/set a subset of features on a mounted fs
